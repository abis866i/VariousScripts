# adblocklists
Just some scripts that I use in my browser to block some annoying ads.
## SameDomain user script
This script hides all the hyperlinks with href that is not the same with the url of the site I visited. 
## HideElements user script
This script hides elements such as div, a, or img. I use it mostly with the uzbl browser.
